<h1>Open Legend Roller privacy policy</h1>

<p>No information you provide to the app is ever sent to us. Information entered in usage of the HeroMuster import functionality is sent to them and is subject to <a href="https://heromuster.com/privacy">their privacy policy</a></p>

<p>I hope this counts as a proper privacy policy, idk, I'm some college student who wants their friends to have an app they made, I'm not a lawyer.</p>
