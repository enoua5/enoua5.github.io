        <p>
          I have always been deeply interested in computer science and
          mathematics, and am continually looking to learn new technologies and
          skills. I started teaching myself to code in 2015, after feeling
          unchallenged by high school's computing class, and have continued to
          improve my skills as a developer considerably through a variety of
          hobby projects. These projects range from games, to apps, to utility
          programs, through which I like to challenge myself to not only improve
          in my general abilities, but also to learn new technologies and
          concepts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated Magna cum Laude with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
          Science and Minor in Mathematics from Weber State University in 2023.
